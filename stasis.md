LVLCAP — STASIS

—

“… sometimes i generate 98 realities at a time…”

(scenes of abstract creation blur by User’s head)

“… this part is my favorite!”

(head on view of User, tears streaming from behind VR headset)

…

(nothing but the sound of wind whipping USer’s body)

“… I could keep generating for–ever!”

( from abstract imagery, the view settles into reality, jagged lines become trees, amoebas become water)

“… I can’t remember when this all started, I’ve seen too many of these to count …”

( User’s hands in various panels outstretched, gesturing, evoking hand symbols )

“… not sure it matters.”

( User steps into liquid )

“… I’ve met others while pausing generation. Some of them tire and choose to stay still in a reality they enjoy.”

( User immersed, User in repose )

“… I don’t want to stay still.”
